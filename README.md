DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
```
After deciding to make a webpage application for tracking expenses, I tried to understand the application logic and how my webpage will interact with the api. I start working on the back end to set up the Expense Controller and manage the CRUD action and test every action to make sure everything is working properly. Before Jumping to the front end application. I Whiteboard How my application will work and interact with the api. I start with making forms in my webpage so I can test Index, Get, Delete and update actions. Then I jumped to styling and I tried to make all the actions on one page with the table that I made. Finally I just cleared my project from any bugs and tried to meet all the requirements.
